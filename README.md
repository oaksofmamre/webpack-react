# webpack-react

Using webpack together with React, and deployed to Heroku

## Notes

I confess this is not the most exciting React app. Nevertheless some pretty awesome technologies are being used: React, and it is configured with the ever useful webpack bundler, uses an Express server in the back-end, and is deployed to Heroku

## Usage

From command-line:

```
npm start
npm run build
```

Deployed to Heroku:
